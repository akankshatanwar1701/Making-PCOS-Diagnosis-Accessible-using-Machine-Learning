# Making PCOS Diagnosis Accessible using Machine Learning
--------------------------------------------

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is one of the most common reasons for female infertility. It’s a lot more than that. Women with PCOS are often insulin resistant, their body can make insulin but can’t use it effectively, which multiplies the risk of diabetes in them. They also have higher levels of androgens (male hormones that females also have), which can stop eggs from being released (ovulation) and cause irregular periods, acne, thinning scalp hair, and excess hair growth on the face and body.  
  
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is very common, but it remains undiagnosed and unmanaged in most people who have it. It may affect roughly 1 in 12 women and people with cycles of reproductive age (8%, or ~6-13%), but this likely varies across populations (1-5). Of those who have it, about 7 in 10 may go undiagnosed. (1,2)
  
## Exploratory Analysis 
----------------------------------------------
  
Here, figuring out some parameters which are easily measurable at home and are less invasive becomes a crucial part of our research. Not only the features should be easily measurable but should have a high correlation with diagnostic accuracy.
  
We performed feature selection to find the important attributes to detect PCOS. In order to do that we are using a dataset of 541 data points with 41 attributes like Weight Gain, Follicles in the left/Right ovary, LHS levels, Hair loss, BMI, Pimples etc. It is important to note here, due to very limited prior research being done in this field it becomes increasingly hard to obtain multiple datasets.
